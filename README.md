<h3>Current Functionality:</h3>
<pre>1. If there are no column names all columns will just get a pipe in between and be converted to .txt.</pre>
<pre>2. If there are column names then the columns will be rearranged to fit the order needed for upload into OR then converted into pipe delimited. Please note that the ResortID column has to be the last column as it is used to break in the code.</pre>
